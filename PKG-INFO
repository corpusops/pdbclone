Description: **Features**
        
          * Implement the most recent Python 3 features of pdb, as defined in the Python 3 `pdb documentation`_. The pdb command line interface remains unchanged except for the new ``detach`` and ``thread`` pdb commands.
        
          * Improve significantly pdb performance. With breakpoints, pdb-clone runs just below the speed of the interpreter while pdb runs 10 to 100 times slower than the interpreter, see `Performances <http://code.google.com/p/pdb-clone/wiki/Performances>`_.
        
          * Extend pdb with remote debugging. A remote debugging session may be started when the program stops at a ``pdb.set_trace_remote()`` hard-coded breakpoint, or at any time and multiple times by attaching to the process main thread. See `RemoteDebugging <http://code.google.com/p/pdb-clone/wiki/RemoteDebugging>`_
        
          * Fix pdb long standing bugs entered in the Python issue tracker, see the `News <http://code.google.com/p/pdb-clone/wiki/News>`_.
        
          * Add a bdb comprehensive test suite (more than 70 tests) and run both pdb and bdb test suites.
        
        pdb-clone runs the same source code on all the supported versions of Python, which are:
        
            * Python 3: from version 3.2 onward.
        
            * Python 2: version 2.7.
        
        See also the `README <http://code.google.com/p/pdb-clone/wiki/ReadMe>`_ and the project `home page <http://code.google.com/p/pdb-clone/>`_.
        
        Report bugs to the `issue tracker <http://code.google.com/p/pdb-clone/issues/list>`_.
        
        **Usage**
        
        Invoke pdb-clone as a script to debug other scripts. For example::
        
            $ pdb-clone myscript.py
        
        Or use one of the different ways of running pdb described in the `pdb documentation`_ and replace::
        
            import pdb
        
        with::
        
            from pdb_clone import pdb
        
        .. _pdb documentation: http://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html
